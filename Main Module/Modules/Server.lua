--[[
		For security reasons we are not showing the source code of this module.
		The reason in detail is because we work with "API codes" to give people the
		ability to script with eden products.
		Releasing these codes to the public would ruin the purpose and would
		give exploiters a bigger chance to mess with our customer experience.

		We value our customers privacy and freedom, we do not insert
		any malicious content that could harm the game or give us a better
		gameplay experience compared to people who do not work at Eden, which will
		now be referred to as "the group",(such as hidden admin).
		The main purpose of the this module is to install products on the server
		and client.
		We upload anonymized data to a third-party platform called
		"Google Analytics" to understand customer interaction of our products and
		which products are installed.

		If you would like to receive an API key please get in contact with the
		owner of the group.
